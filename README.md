Project: The Cozy Corner Café

Concept & Design Choices:

This project is a single-page website for a fictional coffee shop, "The Cozy Corner Café." The goal was to create a warm, inviting, and modern web presence using only HTML and CSS.

The design is built around a warm color palette (browns, beiges, and creams) and a combination of an elegant serif font ('Playfair Display') for headings and a clean sans-serif font ('Roboto') for body text. This contrast aims to be both stylish and highly readable.

The layout is fully responsive, using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox for component alignment (like the navigation bar) and CSS Grid for the menu section. The menu grid is designed to be fluid, automatically adjusting the number of columns based on screen size. Interactivity is added through CSS transitions on buttons and menu cards, providing visual feedback to the user on hover. A subtle keyframe animation on the main heading adds a touch of polish on page load.
